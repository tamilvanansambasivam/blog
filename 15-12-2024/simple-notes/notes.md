# simple notes for problem solving

the brain is a memory prediction-machine. what you need are principles and mental models. learn the principle, then think for yourself. learn by reading and doing, then reflect and delete a lot.

the brain is a factory, not a warehouse. use it to generate ideas and to solve problems. not to store information.

however, storing information does help generation and problem solving. eg: principles, algorithms and mental models.

everything is simple, but not easy.
the problem is that we want everything to be easy, which makes it complicated.
